I'm currently a student at Rice University studying Sport Analytics and Statistics, where I work in Sport Analytics Research and will be the incoming Student Technical Lead for Rice Athletics this fall.

While I'm particularly interested in applications with sports, having been a soccer player since I was 5, I've always been passionate about applying data and analytics to uncover patterns that quantify the nebulous and project the uncertain, no matter what field.

Outside of data science, I love gardening, playing soccer, and working in technical theater.
